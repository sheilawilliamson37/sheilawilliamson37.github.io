        <h2> INGREDIENTS</h2> 
        <ul> <li> 2 1/2 cups vegetable oil 
            <li>4 garlic cloves, thinly sliced
            <li>1 shallot, finely chopped
            <li>1/2 cup walnuts
            <li>1/2 cup red chili flakes
            <li>1 teaspoon salt
            <li>2 teaspoons granulated sugar
            <li>1 teaspoon white pepper
            <li>2 tablespoons paprika</li> 
        <h2> INSTRUCTIONS</h2> 
        <p> 1. Preheat your oven to 350°F. Spread the walnuts out on a baking 
            sheet and toast for about 8 minutes, or until golden and fragrant.
            Let them cool completely, then finely chop. Set aside for later.</p>
            <p> 2.While the walnuts cool, get your heatproof glass jar ready. In 
            the jar, add the red chili flakes, salt, sugar, white pepper, and
             paprika and stir together. </p> 
        <p> 3. In a small pot, heat the vegetable oil over medium heat to
            350°F. Add the sliced garlic and fry until golden brown and 
             crispy, stirring often so it doesn’t burn. Use a slotted spoon
             to transfer the garlic to a paper towel to drain.</p> 
        <p> 4. In the same oil, add the finely chopped shallots and fry until 
            deeply golden and crispy. Remove with a slotted spoon or strain 
            with a sieve over a heat proof bowl and set on a paper towel to 
            drain.</p> 
        <p> 5. Once the garlic and shallots are done, strain the oil through a
             fine mesh sieve to catch any leftover bits. Return the strained 
             oil to the pot and reheat it until shimmering and hot.</p> 
        <p> 6. Once the garlic and shallots are done, strain the oil through a 
            fine mesh sieve to catch any leftover bits. Return the strained oil
             to the pot and reheat it until shimmering and hot.</p> 
        <p> 7. Once the chili oil has slightly cooled, about 5 minutes, stir in
             the reserved fried garlic, fried shallots, and chopped toasted 
             walnuts.</p> 
        <p> 8. Let your chili oil cool completely at room temperature.
             Seal the jar with a lid and store in the fridge — it’ll 
            last for weeks and just gets better over time.</p>
