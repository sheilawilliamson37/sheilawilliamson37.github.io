        </br>
        <h2> INGREDIENTS</h2> 
        <ul><li> 1 pack (12 rolls) King’s Hawaiian sweet rolls
            <li> 1/2 cup milk or semi-sweet chocolate chips or chopped chocolate chunks
            <li> 1/4 cup sliced almonds
            <li> powdered sugar, for dusting on top</li></ul> 
        </br> 
        <h4>ALMOND SIMPLE SYRUP</h4> 
        <ul> 
            <li> 1/4 cup water
            <li> 2 1/2 tablespoons granulated sugar
            <li> 1/2 teaspoon almond extract</li></ul> 
        </br> 
        <h4>ALMOND FILLING</h4> 
        <ul> 
            <li> 3/4 cup almond flour
            <li> 1/3 cup + 1 tablespoon granulated white sugar 
            <li>1/8 teaspoon salt
            <li>6 tablespoons unsalted butter, room temperature
            <li> 1 teaspoon vanilla extract
            <li> 1/4 teaspoon almond extract
            <li> 1 large egg</li></ul>
        </br> 
        <ol>     
            <h2> INSTRUCTIONS</h2> 
            <p> 1. Preheat your oven to 350°F (175°C) and line a baking dish or 
            sheet tray with parchment paper.</p> 
            h4> MAKE THE ALMOND SIMPLE SYRUP:</h4> 
            <p> 2. In a small saucepan, combine water, sugar, and almond extract.
             Heat over medium heat, stirring until the sugar fully dissolves.
              Remove from heat and set aside to cool.</p> 
            <h4> MAKE THE ALMOND FILLING:</h4> 
            <p> 3. In a mixing bowl, add almond flour, granulated sugar, a pinch 
            of salt, unsalted butter, one egg, vanilla extract, and almond 
            extract. Beat everything together until smooth and creamy. Reserve
            about ¼ cup of the filling to use for dolloping on top later.</p> 
            <h4>PREPARE AND BAKE THE ROLLS:</h4>          
            <p> 4. Without pulling them apart, slice the entire pack of King’s 
            Hawaiian rolls in half horizontally like a sandwich. Place the 
            bottom half in your prepared dish.</p> 
            <p> 5. Brush the inside of both the bottom and top halves (cut sides 
            only) with the almond simple syrup.</p>       
            <p> 6. Spread the majority of the almond filling evenly over the bottom 
            half of the rolls. Sprinkle chocolate chips or chopped chocolate 
            all over the filling.</p>   
            <p> 7. Place the top half of the rolls back on. Spoon little dollops of
             the reserved almond filling across the top of the rolls. Press 
             sliced almonds into the filling.</p>
            <p> 8. Bake uncovered for 12 to 15 minutes, or until the tops are 
            golden and the filling on top is set and slightly crisped.</p>
            <p> 9. Let cool slightly, dust with powdered sugar, and pull apart to 
            serve warm and gooey!</p></ol>

        <h2>HONEY BUTTER TOAST</h2> 
        </br> 
        <p> PREP TIME: 10 MINUTES</p>
        <p>COOK TIME: 20 MINUTES</p>
        <p>TOTAL TIME: 30 MINUTES</p>
        <p>YIELDS: 6</p>
        <br></br>
        <h2> INGREDIENTS </h2> 
        <ul> 
            <li> 6 or 12 slices white sandwich bread (use 12 if the bread is 
                thin and stack them in pairs; use 6 if the slices are thick)
            <li>1 cup unsalted butter, melted</li> 
            <li>1/3 cup honey</li> 
            <li>3/4 cup brown sugar</li> 
            <li>1/2 tablespoon vanilla extract</li> 
            <li>1/4 teaspoon salt</li> </ul> 
        </br> 
        <ol> 
        <h2>INSTRUCTIONS</h2> 
        <p> 1. Preheat the oven to 350°F.</p>  
        <p>2. If you're using thin white sandwich bread, use 12 slices
                 and stack two on top of each other to make 6 thicker pieces. 
                 Just make sure the bread isn’t too soft—something like fresh 
                 Wonder Bread won’t hold its shape well. If you're using a 
                 whole loaf, slice it into pieces about 1.75 to 2 inches thick.
                 </p>  
        <p>3. Slice off all the crusts before moving on.</p>  
        <p>4. In a microwave-safe bowl, mix together the melted unsalted 
                 butter, honey, light brown sugar, vanilla, and a pinch of salt.
                  Microwave for 30 seconds to 1 minute, then whisk really well 
                  until it turns into a smooth, glossy syrup.</p>  
        <p>5. Coat each piece of bread generously on all sides with the 
                  syrup and place them on a nonstick baking pan—no parchment
                   needed.</p>  
        <p>6. Bake for 15 minutes, then carefully flip each one and bake  
                for another 5 minutes until golden and sticky all over.</p>  
        <p>7. Let them cool for about 10 minutes before serving. They’ll 
                feel soft right out of the oven but will crisp up beautifully 
                as they cool slightly. Enjoy them warm!</p></ol>

            <p> 3. Press the mixture into the bottom of the prepared pan, creating 
             an even crust. Set aside.

            <p> 4. Preheat the oven to 325°F (163°C).
            <p>5. In a large bowl, beat the cream cheese and white sugar together 
            until smooth and creamy using an electric mixer.

            the top with a spatula.
            <p>9. Bake for 35 minutes, or until the edges are set but the center is
             slightly jiggly.
            <p>10.Let the cheesecake cool on the counter for 1 hour, then transfer
            it to the refrigerator to chill for at least 4 hours, or overnight.

            cheesecake layer.
